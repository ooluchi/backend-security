## Week 1
- What I built: Node "Hello API", Python calculator
- Security I added: plan for helmet/CORS/rate limit (Week 2)
- Scans I ran: npm audit (GitHub Actions)
- Issues found: 0 high/critical
- Evidence: (link to Actions run)

## Threat Model (short)

- Important data: (none yet—coming later)
- Risks to watch: IDOR, secret leaks, brute force
